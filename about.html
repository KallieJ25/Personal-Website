<h3>When I am not working or learning, I enjoy:</h3>
<h4>Video Games</h4>
<p>Playing video games is something I have been doing since I was about 5 years old.</p>
<p>When I was 11 I began learning how to use a computer and that kick started my heavy interest in PC gaming.</p>
<p>Games I play today: Final Fantasy XIV, League of Legends, Monster Hunter World, Apex Legends, Dying Light and many more.</p>

<h4>Art</h4>
<p>While I wouldn't consider myself an artist, I do enjoy dabbling into it from time to time.</p>
<p>Some art I enjoy doing include: painting, doodling, and recently digital art.</p>
