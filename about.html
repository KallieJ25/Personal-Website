    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section>
<p>I have been working at Amazon for 4 years as a customer service representative.</p>
<p>I am currently learning how to become a Software Developer at Fullstack Academy.</p>
<p>My goals are to land a job as a Web Developer and to continue to keep developing other skills that I want to learn in the tech field.</p>

<h3>When I am not working or learning, I enjoy:</h3>
<h5>Video Games</h5>
<p>Playing video games is something I have been doing since I was about 5 years old.</p>
<p>When I was 11 I began learning how to use a computer and that kick started my heavy interest in PC gaming.</p>
<p>Games I play today: Final Fantasy XIV, League of Legends, Monster Hunter World, Apex Legends, Dying Light and many more.</p>

<h5>Art</h5>
<p>While I wouldn't consider myself an artist, I do enjoy dabbling into it from time to time.</p>
<p>Some art I enjoy doing include: painting, doodling, and recently digital art.</p>
