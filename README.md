# Portfolio
This was created to provide not only information about myself but also the work I've done while learning Web Development.
The site includes a home page that gives an introduction.
It includes a page that shares some interests of mine.
The portfolio page gives a demonstration of some of the work that I've done so far.

More updates to come! Any suggestions are welcomed.
